# Modeling House Prices in King County
## Module 2 Housing Project

### Business Problem: <br/>
In this project I conducted an exploratory data analysis into house prices in King County, Washington. <br/>

I assumed the role of a data scientist in a startup realty firm created to help prospective sellers offload their homes for the highest price possible. 
My goal was to effectively use the King County Housing Sales dataset to create an accurate multiple linear regression model to predict housing prices in King County, Washington. I also aimed to answer the following questions: <br/>
* Are bedrooms or bathrooms more significant when it comes to affecting the home price?
* Does a bigger house directly correlate to a more expensive house?
* What is the single most important variable related to home price?
* What significance, if any, does zipcode have on home prices?
* Does the lot size or house size more closely correlate to a higher home price?

### Methods: 
I used the OSEMN data science process(Obtain, Scrub, Explore, Model, iNterpret).  

I used Python 3 and the following libraries to process and model the data: NumPy, pandas, Statsmodels, scikit-learn, SciPy, itertools, math, matplotlib, and seaborn.
